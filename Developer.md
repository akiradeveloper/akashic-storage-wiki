My name is Akira Hayakawa.

I am a Japanese and currently living in Tokyo.

I am a real storage developer who has experienced from developing embedded operating system
to web infrastructure like this project **akashic-storage**.

I am very enthusiastic about open source softwares and contributed to several OSS projects. The most successful self-hosting project is [dm-writeboost](https://github.com/akiradeveloper/dm-writeboost), a SSD caching Linux kernel module.
